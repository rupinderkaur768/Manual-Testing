|Critical|High-impact defects that significantly impair application functionality but do not completely block testing. These issues need urgent attention but can be temporarily worked around.|Major features are not working as expected.|
|Major|Important defects that impact functionality and usability but do not stop the application from working. These should be resolved in the next release or update.|Problems that reduce application efficiency or performance.|
|Minor|Low-impact defects that do not significantly affect application functionality or performance. These issues are often cosmetic or involve minor user experience improvements.|Cosmetic issues or UI glitches.|
