# Project Details
|  Name | Description | Tools & Techniques Used |
| Box | Box is a cloud-based platform that lets you securely store, manage, and share files. It's like having a digital filing cabinet accessible from your computer, phone, or tablet. You can collaborate with others on documents, control who sees your files, and even work on them offline. Think of it as a central hub for all your important documents. | JIRA & Agile|
